**Sedimentary Rock Classification using CNN**

This project focuses on classifying three types of sedimentary rocks—Coal, Limestone, and Sandstone—using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Sedimentary rocks are identified based on their texture, grain size, color, and mineral composition. Manual classification requires expertise and can be time-consuming.

By using deep learning, image-based rock identification becomes faster, consistent, and suitable for educational and laboratory applications. The CNN model learns texture patterns and visual features from rock images and predicts the correct class with good accuracy, demonstrating the usefulness of computer vision in geological studies.
